# Siri Who? 🗣️

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little experiment with voice controls. I got tired of clicking buttons all day and thought "why not just talk to my web browser?" So here we are - a fun web app that listens to your voice commands and does cool stuff in response. Plus, it has these cute animated avatars that move their mouths when you talk!

## What's Cool About This?

- 🎤 Just talk to it! No more clicking around
- 🤖 Watch the avatars chat back and forth with you
- 🎨 Change colors, make text bigger, rotate stuff - all with your voice
- 🌓 Dark mode support (because we all need it)
- 🎵 Can even play some tunes for you
- 🔄 Don't like what you did? Just say "reset" and start over

## Try These Voice Commands

You can tell it to:
- "Make text bigger" (if you're sitting far from the screen)
- "Change color to blue" (or red, if you're feeling spicy)
- "Rotate the box" (just for fun)
- "Play music" (and "pause music" when you've had enough)
- "Switch to dark mode" (your eyes will thank you)
- "Reset" (when you want to start fresh)

## Want to Try It Out?

1. Just clone it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pragmaticdev798/siriwho.git
```

2. Hop into the folder:
```bash
cd siriwho
```

3. Open up `index.html` in your browser and start talking!

## Heads Up! 🚨

- You'll need a newer browser (Chrome works best)
- It's gonna ask for microphone access (I promise I'm not spying on you!)
- If something breaks, try Chrome or Edge first

## Tech Stuff I Used

- Plain old HTML/CSS/JavaScript (kis!)
- Web Speech API (for the voice magic)
- Web Audio API (for those sweet audio visualizations)
- Canvas API (for the animated faces)
